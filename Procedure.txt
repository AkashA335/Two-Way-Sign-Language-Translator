    There are Two models in Sign To Text, one is using mediapipe (for Action/Gestures) another is CannyEdge (for Alphabets and numbers).

    Step 6 : Install Requirements of "Action To Text" and Run it in the following Order:
                1. collectImages.py
                2. modelTrain.py

                3. modelTraining.py
                4. modelInference.py
